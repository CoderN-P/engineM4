# engineM4
This is a simple Pygame API wrapper. It was originally created by my CS teacher, Max Mcintyre. However, I have added more code and decided to use github to version control it.


## Usage
```python
while True:
  ... # Your game code here
  e.runGame((0, 0, 0) # Can be any tuple representing an RGB combination
  
 ```
